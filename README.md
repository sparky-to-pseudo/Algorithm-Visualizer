# Algorithm-Visualizer
GUI based algorithm visualizer


Find new ways to visually represent algorithms in a GUI using C++.


# Shortest Paths

Start simple with a shortest path alogrithm on a grid with obsticals in the way.

- Create a GUI with a grid and drop down menus for options
- Within the grid create obsticals
- Have the user click between two points
- Caclulate the shortest path with the obsticals in the way
- Visually show the path the algorithm took.
